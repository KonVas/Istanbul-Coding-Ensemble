# Instructions for engagement for Adventures in C
## The performance will last around 45 minutes following these rules below.

+ First 5': live coders start the performance with soundscape and drony sounds.
+ Instruments start introducing patterns.
+ Main performance will approximately last for 20'.
3.1 Live coders will have to make a solo with notes picked from the musicians, arranged via Utopia or eye contact.
+ The performance will culminate in a noisy/stochastic improvisation by the laptops slightly similar to the introduction.

As a general rule, during the performance the musicians will create build ups and tension and then thin out, according to some system.
